# CLAUDE.md Templates

Use these as starting structures. Only include sections relevant to the project. Customize every line — never ship a template placeholder.

## Template: Minimal Project Root

```markdown
## Project

<2-4 sentences: what this does, what system it belongs to>

## Stack

<language, runtime, framework, versions>

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `<command>` | <description> |

## Conventions

- <non-obvious pattern>

## Gotchas

## Template: Comprehensive Project Root

```markdown
## Project

<2-4 sentences>

## Stack

<language, runtime, framework, database, test runner, build tool — with versions>

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `<build>` | <description> |
| `<test>` | <description> |
| `<lint>` | <description> |
| `<dev>` | <description> |

## Data Models

- `<path/to/schema>` — <what it defines, who consumes it>
- <non-obvious shape constraint or codegen pipeline>

## Conventions

- <non-obvious pattern not enforced by tooling>

## Architecture

```
<dir>/    # <purpose>
<dir>/    # <purpose>
```

## Constraints

- Never do X — because Y
